## Course Description

This course introduces new front-end web developers to the modern tools, technologies, and best practices used to build professional, standards-based websites and web applications. Students will gain hands-on experience with the three pillars of front-end development—HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript—while learning how to use modern development environments, package managers, build tools, and browser APIs.

Through practical labs and guided exercises, students will build interactive web pages, explore responsive design techniques, and connect to APIs using AJAX and Fetch. The course also provides an introduction to popular libraries and frameworks, giving students a sense of the current front-end landscape without overwhelming detail.

By the end of the course, students will be able to confidently create, style, and script modern web applications and understand how to collaborate effectively using version control and common developer tools.
